# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for uploading and organizing the code for the paper "Coverage-based Evaluation of Scenarios for Autonomous Driving
System"

## Phase 1: Core Logic and Basic Functionality

*   **[In progress]** Upload the core Python scripts for recording and definition the coverage metrics.
*   **[To Do]** Include a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies.

## Phase 2: Data and Evaluation

*   **[To Do]** Upload the scripts used for data processing and scenario extraction.
*   **[To Do]** Provide a sample of the dataset used for the evaluation.

## Phase 3: Documentation and Usability

*   **[To Do]** Write a comprehensive `README.md` with detailed instructions on how to run the code.
*   **[To Do]** Add examples and tutorials to demonstrate how to use the coverage metrics on new data.
*   **[To Do]** Clean up the code, add comments, and ensure it follows a consistent style.
